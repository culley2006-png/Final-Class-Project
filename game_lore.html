    <h2>About “No, I'm Not Human”</h2>
    <p>
      “No, I'm Not a Human” is a horror simulation on Steam where you must decide who to shelter at night — people knock on your door under the burning sun, and they might be “Visitors” or humans. The quiet tension builds by day through TV broadcasts revealing new traits to watch out for, and by night the decisions are grim and desperate. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

     <h2>Here is some lore and background behind the game No I'm Not Human</h2>
    <section class="lore">
      <p>
        The world of No I'm Not Human takes place in a near-future town cut off from outside help, where strange beings called “Visitors” walk among ordinary people. The game uses a quiet, unnerving atmosphere: daytime broadcasts and scattered documents drip-feed background information while nightly decisions force the player to weigh mercy against survival.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visitors:</strong> Entities that resemble humans but display subtle physical anomalies. Public service announcements gradually reveal traits to watch for.</li>
        <li><strong>Humans:</strong> Civilians seeking shelter. Each night the player chooses who to take in, with limited space and unpredictable outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>The TV:</strong> A narrative device that changes over time — news segments, expert panels, and emergency alerts expand lore and introduce new mechanics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Characters & Types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Pale:</strong> Tall, unnervingly calm. Encounters with this figure imply a long game — he appears at critical story beats.</li>
        <li><strong>The Visitor Variants:</strong> Different guests carry distinct tells (perfect teeth, dirty nails, altered eye reflection). The exact set of traits can shift between playthroughs.</li>
        <li><strong>Unnamed Reporter/Anchors:</strong> Voices in broadcasts who offer exposition, sometimes contradicting each other and raising doubts about the official narrative.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Game Documents & Worldbuilding</h3>
      <p>
        Fragments like police bulletins, diary entries, and leaked memos suggest several overlapping explanations: an emergent pathogen, a clandestine experiment, and social panic interacting in unpredictable ways. Because information is fragmented, players must assemble a working theory from unreliable sources.
      </p>

      <h3>Notable Events (Timeline)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>First reports of “unusual” guests and the institution of nightly shelter protocols.</li>
        <li>Escalation of TV directives and changing lists of Visitor traits.</li>
        <li>Widespread distrust, formation of neighborhood watch groups, and rumors of a recurring, highly dangerous individual.</li>
        <li>Multiple endings reveal different outcomes for the town depending on choices and hidden conditions.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Themes & Hidden Layers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Moral ambiguity:</strong> The game forces trade-offs with no clearly “correct” choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Information control:</strong> Official broadcasts may mislead, making skepticism a useful stance.</li>
        <li><strong>Pattern recognition:</strong> Repeated details and seemingly minor clues can unlock alternate story paths and endings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Player Tips That Tie to Lore</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pay attention to small, repeated details in broadcasts and guest dialogue — they often reference the same backstory fragments.</li>
        <li>Keep a mental log of trait combinations: a trait that looks harmless early can become crucial later.</li>
        <li>Experiment with different sheltering strategies across saves to uncover branching lore and hidden documents.</li>
      </ul>
