        One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games, especially cooperative ones where teamwork is key. 
        A game I play a lot is <strong>Deep Rock Galactic</strong>. It's a cooperative first-person shooter where 
        you play as space dwarves mining dangerous caves full of aliens, minerals, and hazards.

        I enjoy it because it combines strategy, teamwork, and action. The classes all have different roles: 
        the Gunner clears enemies, the Driller makes tunnels, the Engineer sets up defenses, and the Scout lights 
        the caves. My favorite part is working with friends to explore, fight off swarms, and escape by the skin 
        of our teeth.

        Beyond gaming, I also enjoy tending to my toads, listening to music, and spending time 
        relaxing with creative projects. Hobbies are a way for me to recharge and enjoy life outside of school 
        and work.
